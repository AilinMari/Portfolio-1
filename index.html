            My name is Ailin-Mari Høidahl Bøe, and I am soon to be 30 years old.
            <br />I am studying Front-end development at Noroff.<br />
            I have also been studying media and communication earlier on, that
            included grafic design, photography, video making, and different
            kinds of marketing of the different media we were making.

            I have been working as a hairdresser for almost 10 years, and I have
            been working as a hairdresser-teacher for about 3 years. I wanted to
            work even more with my creative mind in different ways, so I started
            studying Front-end development in Mars 2024. This is now my
            portfolio page where I will show you the work I have done so far as
            a Front-end developer.
